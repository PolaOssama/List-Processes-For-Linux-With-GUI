# List-Processes-For-Linux-With-GUI

It's a **Process Manger** for Linux OS same as **Task Manager** in Windows OS that:

1. List all the processes in the system.
2. List all the processes grouped by user.
3. Display process ID of all the processes.
4. Run/stop a specific process.
5. Send specific signals to a specific process.

The project provide a menu interface to let the user picks the option he wants and it will be closed after executing only one option, instead the menu has to re-appear until the user picks exit .
